    "The objective for this MP is to build an interpreter for a minimalist\n",
    "dialect of Lisp called Scheme. You will learn to build a fully monadic\n",
    "evaluator, and a read-evaluate-print-loop (REPL) to accept input from\n",
    "user.\n",
    "\n",
    "This language will have the normal things you would expect in a\n",
    "Lisp-like language, such as functions, numbers, symbols, and lists. You\n",
    "will also write a macro system and explore how to use it. Macros give\n",
    "you the ability to program your programming language, redefining it to\n",
    "be anything you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Understand the basic syntax of Scheme and how to evaluate programs in it\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Understand how to simulate stateful computation by composing monads, and write seemingly imperative but under-the-hood functional code in Haskell\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Create an REPL for your interpreter which handles manipulating the environment based on inputs from the user\n",
    "    • Understand homoiconicity and metacircular evaluation via Scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevant Files\n",
    "\n",
    "In the directory app/, you will find the program code, some of which is\n",
    "only partially implemented, and which you will have to modify to\n",
    "complete this assignment. The file test/Tests.hs contains the code used\n",
    "for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running Code\n",
    "\n",
    "To run your code, start GHCi with stack ghci (make sure to load the Main\n",
    "module if stack ghci doesn’t automatically do it). From here, you can\n",
    "test individual functions, or you can run the REPL by calling main. Note\n",
    "that the initial \\$ and \\> are prompts.\n",

    "\n",
    "with stack exec main.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "You are able to run the test-suite with stack test:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\$ stack test\n",
    "\n",
    "It will tell you which test-suites you pass, fail, and have exceptions\n",
    "on. To see an individual test-suite (so you can run the tests yourself\n",
    "by hand to see where the failure happens), look in the file\n",
    "test/Spec.hs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run individual test-sets by running stack ghci and loading the\n",
    "Spec module with :l Spec. Then you can run the tests (specified in\n",
    "test/Tests.hs) just by using the name of the test:\n",
    "\n",
    "Look in the file test/Tests.hs to see which tests were run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given Code\n",
    "\n",
    "In directory app/:\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Main.hs: partially implemented REPL frontend In directory app/Scheme/:\n",

    "\n",
    "Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Like previous assignments, the environment is a HashMap. You can access\n",
    "functions like lookup, union and insert through prefix H, such as:\n",
    "H.lookup\n",
    "\n",
    "2\n",
    "\n",
    "type Env = H.HashMap String Val\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract Syntax Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we offer you the Scheme AST. From your previous experience, do you\n",
    "notice anything unusual?\n",
    "\n",
    "data Val = Symbol String\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Boolean Bool\n",

    "    • DottedList [Val] Val\n",
    "\n",
    "    • List [Val]\n",
    "\n",
    "    • PrimFunc ([Val] -> EvalState Val)  -- Primitive function,\n",

    "        ◦ implemented in Haskell\n",
    "\n",
    "Func \\[String\\] Val Env – Closure  \n",
    "  Macro \\[String\\] Val – Macro  \n",
    "  Void – No value\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s right, the AST data type is Val, not Exp! Scheme, as well as\n",
    "other Lisps, is a homoiconic language, meaning that the text of the\n",
    "language and the values have the same structure as its AST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code is data. Data is code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions from the programmer are now encoded as values: numbers,\n",
    "booleans, symbols and lists. When you feed such a value to the\n",
    "evaluator, the evaluator treats it as an expression and evaluates it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we’ll describe what the different values mean, and provide some\n",
    "examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinds of values\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Symbol\n",
    "\n",
    "Symbol is just a symbol. In previous MPs, a symbol expression, a.k.a.\n",
    "SymExp, was meant to be evaluated as a variable name bound to a value.\n",
    "In Scheme, this is no longer the case. Not only can you have values\n",
    "bound to a symbol, you can also use symbols themselves as a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Boolean\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be true #t or false #f.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Number\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer. We do not support floating point in this MP.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. List\n",
    "\n",
    "3\n",
    "\n",
    "A List (that is, a “proper” Scheme list; keep reading!) is a list of\n",
    "values terminated by an empty proper list. Scheme theoretically would\n",
    "define lists using pairs recursively, like this: a proper list would be\n",
    "a pair with a single item on the left and another proper list on the\n",
    "right. As a base case, there would be the special empty list (), which\n",
    "might be called “nil” or “null”. However, we can get a speed advantage\n",
    "by simply using Haskell’s native lists to implement our version of\n",
    "Scheme lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scheme syntax, a proper list could be created like (1 2 3) or\n",
    "equivalently like (1 . (2 . (3 . () ))) where the . is a pair separator.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. DottedList\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Scheme theoretically uses pairs to make lists, we have a\n",
    "dilemma: what if the “list” isn’t formed correctly as described above? A\n",
    "DottedList potentially represents an “improper” list of values: it can\n",
    "be ended by some non-null tail value (e.g. (1 2 . 3)). This is\n",
    "theoretically what you would get in Scheme if you kept nesting pairs on\n",
    "the right side of pairs, but where the rightmost nested item was not the\n",
    "empty list value, but some other value. In our implementation using\n",
    "Haskell, we make a type distinction between these “improper” dotted\n",
    "lists and the “proper” null-terminated lists, defining separate\n",
    "constructors: the DottedList constructor allows the trailing non-null\n",
    "value to be specified explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction allows us to utilize Haskell’s native list data\n",
    "structure for better performance. This will also simplify our\n",
    "implementation of some other Scheme routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because DottedList might be used to provide a null list as the\n",
    "trailing value, lists and dotted lists that are constructed differently\n",
    "can be equivalent by value. We offer you a useful helper function,\n",
    "flattenList, which flattens a DottedList to the simplest form; the\n",
    "flattening may simplify a dotted list to a proper list if possible, to a\n",
    "non-list singleton type, or to a simpler improper list that’s still\n",
    "dotted. You will find it extremely useful when implementing primitive\n",
    "functions in the runtime, and you may want to use flattenList whenever\n",
    "you are trying to do Haskell pattern matching on a Scheme list. (That\n",
    "includes cases where you’re passing a Scheme list to a Haskell function\n",
    "that has multiple definitions! Remember, in Haskell, that does pattern\n",
    "matching.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here are the results of flattening some proper and improper\n",
    "lists. When the left of the dot is blank, the right hand side is\n",
    "flattened recursively. The fourth example is an improper list, so it\n",
    "remains a dotted list after flattening.\n",

    "2 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. PrimFunc\n",
    "\n",
    "A primitive function is a function defined in Haskell, lifted to Scheme.\n",
    "The type constructor PrimFunc takes a function that takes an argument\n",
    "list and returns an evaluation state, encapsulating either both the\n",
    "result of evaluation and the environment, or a Diagnostic thrown along\n",
    "the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    7. Func\n",
    "\n",
    "A closure has an argument list, a body, and a captured environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a side note, we are not implementing the reference memory model for\n",
    "Scheme. Thus functions are passed by value, i.e. all variables of the\n",
    "closure environment will be copied upon the copy of a closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "    8. Macro\n",
    "\n",
    "A macro has an argument list and a body. The body will be first\n",
    "trans-formed to an expanded body by the evaluator, and the expanded body\n",
    "gets fed back into the evaluator again. We’ll talk about it in detail in\n",
    "the evaluation section.\n",
    "\n",
    "    9. Void\n",
    "\n",
